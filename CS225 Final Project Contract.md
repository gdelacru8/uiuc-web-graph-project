## **Communication:**

1. **Team Meetings:** For our team meetings, we will meet twice a week, Wednesdays at 3:30-4:30 and Sundays 1:00-2:30. We will meet in person and will each bring the materials needed to work on the project. If for any reason someone is unable to attend the meeting they may use Zoom or just Discord to still work and collaborate on the project during our meeting time. Each week we will assign a group member to draft that week&#39;s development log entry and commit it to git.

1. **Assistance:** There are a variety of ways that team members will be able to contact each other for assistance. We have already created a discord group where we will be able to contact each other either on our phones or computers whenever needed. However, although we have these methods of communication, it is up to each of the team members to be diligent in responding to the messages quickly and not causing confusion or distress with not being able to reach one another. Worse comes to worse there is always the possibility of just reaching each other by email by using the net-ids shown at the top of the contract.

1. **Respect:** It is vital that we have a group where everyone feels comfortable and is willing to share ideas that they have with the rest of the group. It is important to recognize that although we are all in the same class, different groupmates have different strengths and weaknesses when it comes to different aspects of coding, communication, and collaboration. It is therefore important that each groupmate is willing to help each other when another teammate is having difficulties and to also encourage and give praise to teammates when they complete a task. Also it is important to treat each other as equal and with respect. Failing to do so should result in a conversation where people will voice their opinions in an effort to find a common ground and resolve the conflict. We want an environment that is welcoming and motivating so that we can be productive and efficient with the time that we are together.

### **Collaboration:**

1. **Work Distribution:** Each week we will discuss as a group the necessary deliverables and designate tasks to each member. We will record what specific goals are for that week for each person so everyone is clear on expectations. If an individual&#39;s workload becomes greater than expected or there are unexpected difficulties, we as a group will reevaluate and can assist as necessary.

1. **Time Commitment:** Given the importance and size of the project, it is important that we each dedicate a sufficient amount of time to the workload so that we can stay on track. We already will be meeting for a total two and half hours during the week in person, but there will also be time that we will be spending individually. Individually we think 2-6 hours is a reasonable amount of time given that we are no longer having labs or MPs due. If someone is noticeably lagging behind in the work that they are responsible for completing we will discuss any issues that may be showing up for that person and try to resolve the issues in a kind and understanding manner. If we are unable to resolve the issue, or we feel like a team member is not committed to the project we may find it necessary to contact a staff member and continue the discussion with them.

1. **Conflict Resolution:** If any conflicts arise throughout our group project, we&#39;ll try and resolve these issues through communication with one another. If a partner wasn&#39;t able to finish their part in time, we&#39;ll try to work together and split up any remaining work.
