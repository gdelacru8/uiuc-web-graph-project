# Development Log 

- Week of November 29th

This week we organized and structured our project files in our repo. We also figured out how to construct the make file and testing files. We parsed our graph data and read it into our graph. We planned out and implemented how to process and store our graph structure. We decided to use a hash map where the keys are vertex URLs and the values are a vector of adjacent vertices representing edges going out of each vertex. We wrote test cases for testing to make sure the graph was being processed and stored correctly. Finally, we implemented BFS for our graph and tested it.

We cleaned up the urls used for our project to avoid duplicates as well as added an output for the BFS traversal. We also added test cases for the traversal to make sure the outputs were properly set. Next, we implemented the functions neccesary for generating the graphic output of our graph, and changed the colors of nodes based on their centrality values. There was an attempt at completing brandes' algorithm to find the centrality probabilities for each node. We also updated the README to the specifications of the rubric and implemented a method to color the nodes based off of the theoretical output of Brandes algorithm.

We finished the README and made our presentation slides, video, and results. Added all of these to the README and committed. We also did some final code cleanup to make it more readable and made sure that all test cases were working correctly and executables were giving the desired output.
